                voluntary jobs. We would to also have them enhance Internship programs, Volunteering opportunities, Job Shadowing and Mentorships. This initiative
                also provides another way for companies to plough back to the nation by helping young people achieve their dreams from an awkward position because
                permanent job opportunities are scarce.</p>

                <p>T.H.T is highly interested in finding alternative ways for the unemployed youth of Eswatini to consecutively get short-term job opportunities from various employers.
                    The sole purpose (beyond earning) is to help them gain work experience and increase their potential so that they eventually be employable and be empowered to develop new ideas to start their own businesses, though not permanently employed. The Hustlers Time is an ongoing project, as the name implies,
                we want to turn the other side of the coin and explore other alternatives that be put in place to curb unemployment rate and at the same time produce a workforce that will be game-changer in the industry.
                We want to stress out need to also focus on effectively matching individuals with the right opportunities based on their skills, interests, and potential they are practically showcasing.</p>
                <p>
                    By emphasizing potential and merit over other constraints, we are helping to create a more equitable job market and increase the chances for young individuals to succeed in their careers.
                    This can involve thorough assessments, interviews, and understanding the needs of both job-seekers and employers.
